# E27 — log (the game shell)

Done tasks in full, oldest first. Grep a task id (`## M1 T1a`); never read it whole once it grows.

## M0 — the refinement (2026-11-12)

On `client/e27-m0` (docs only) and `shared/e27-m0` (BACKLOG), with the user; `master` at `2baf95b`
(#866 and #867 merged that morning). No original data staged.

- **Read before the questions:** `h3_game::GameSetup` and `PlayerSetup` (`crates/h3-game/src/setup.rs`,
  `town.rs`'s `PlayerStart`): the human flag, the faction's choice, the hero's pick and its offer
  (TWN-SET-006), the difficulty, `validate`; no starting bonus, handicap or victory and defeat
  (GAM-RES-003: "a computer player's bonus and the handicap (E10)"); `h3-files`' adventure replay
  format (v12) as a save; the map-client lane's HANDOFF: 8 of the 160 shipped maps import whole.
- **The clips:** the table of the installation's `Data/VIDEO.VID` (173 entries) and
  `Data/H3ab_ahd.vid` (7) listed on the user's computer by a short script reading only the
  tables (`device_bash`, the installation read only); the result in `E27-design.md` §1.
- **Asked** (four questions at once) and **answered:** CLT-Q79 (the setup: `GameSetup`, E10 adds
  what it lacks, stubbed until then, no new crate), CLT-Q80 (FFmpeg's Smacker decoder ported),
  CLT-Q81 (the screens built, the effects stubbed), CLT-Q82 (four milestones, the campaign screens
  to E20); the agent's stated defaults kept (CLT-Q83).
- **Written:** the epic refined (decisions 4 to 8, the scope without campaigns, M1's tasks), the
  design note §1, M1's tasks in the lane's queue (the inbox's E27 entry to the archive), the
  adventure lane's inbox (E10's gaps), the map-client lane's (the hand-over, the system menu);
  BACKLOG's E27 in progress and E20 with the campaign screens (`shared/e27-m0`).
