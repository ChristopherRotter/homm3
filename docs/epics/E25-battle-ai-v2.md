# E25 — Battle AI v2

Status: **in progress**, refined 2026-10-27 (AI-Q10); increments 1 and 2 closed 2026-10-28 and 29, increment 3 refined · Lane: **ai** ·
Follows E06 (closed 2026-10-27: `t7-1` the battle AI v1, record `E06-log.md`)

## Goal

A battle agent that beats the faithful system actor (the original's battle AI, ADR-0027) on the
held-out encounters, where E06's battle AI v1 beats the heuristic bots but loses to it. It plays
on every battlefield and in sieges, is trained by E06's pipeline (ADR-0026), and is legitimate:
it reads only its side's observation, and its search too (ADR-0025 point 12a).

## Decisions at the refinement (the user, 2026-10-27, AI-Q10)

1. **The target: beat the faithful system actor** (exit criterion 1). On the report set v1
   against the system actor (the faithful profile, its `POLICY_VERSION` recorded), both sides
   weighed equally, the sampled policy: a win rate above 0.5 and a positive value efficiency. On
   the neutral set v1, in the player's seat against it: a value efficiency above the system
   actor's own in that seat on the same episodes (the bots' table, `bots-neutral-v1.json`:
   +0.285 at E06's revision). Against Random, Aggressor and Greedy still a win rate above 0.5 and
   a positive value (E06's decision 7 as revised). Judged as E06's: the lineage's latest promoted
   network, each point estimate (ADR-0026 point 7). It can be revised at a checkpoint with
   evidence.
2. **The faithful system actor trains no agent** (ADR-0026 point 8 amended). It reads the whole
   state (ADR-0027 point 4 lists what a player may not see). From E25 on it is no league member,
   no defender of the neutral kinds in training, and `system_share` stays 0. It is the target, a
   ladder opponent and a diagnostic's opponent only. `t7-1`, trained with it in E06, stays the
   baseline. A **fair variant** that decides on its side's observation is the battle lane's to
   build later (ADR-0027 point 4; the battle lane's inbox). Once it exists it may train, and it
   becomes the default in games, with the all-seeing one kept as a game option.
3. **Imitation** of the fair variant is a candidate once it exists (a warm start, or an
   auxiliary loss decaying to 0). Never of the faithful one, and never of the heuristic bots,
   which never train (E05 decision 8).
4. **Increment 1: the diagnostics and shaping.** The search's terminal scored by reward v1, T8c
   measured again, and the search on the true battle as the bound on what the guess costs. Beside
   them, potential-based shaping as an A/B run on the user's machine. Their outcome chooses
   increment 2 among the candidates below.
5. **Compute:** runs on the user's machine (GTX 1070, Ryzen 9 3900X), each run's length agreed
   with the user when it is prepared. The sandbox runs short CPU checks and the search's
   measurements.
6. **Unchanged from E06:** reward v1 and the evaluation (shaping changes the training signal
   only); retreat and surrender masked; the truncation penalty; the sampled policy on the
   held-out sets; SPRT promotion; committed records, checkpoints outside git; no new scripted
   bot. A search agent's worlds come from its side's knowledge (ADR-0025 point 12a); the
   true-world search is a diagnostic, never an agent. Increments with a user checkpoint each,
   only the current one refined; the user reviews ADRs and seams; token efficiency beats speed.

## Starting point (from E06)

- **`t7-1`** (`python/records/t7-1.json`; `configs/e06-t7.toml`): the MLP over `symlog` of
  observation v22 (5.95 M parameters), PPO with the PFSP league, γ 1, the truncation penalty, 20 M
  samples with a third neutral (the faithful system actor defending). On the closing engine (E06
  T9c): 0.830, 0.550, 0.530 against Random, Aggressor, Greedy; 0.372 at −0.103 against the system
  actor; the neutral set +0.244 (the system actor's own +0.285).
- **What E06 ruled out** (`E06-log.md`): six levers ended at one ladder. The truncation penalty
  was the gain (T5d); the system actor as an opponent (T6c), the kill preview (T6e) and the turn
  order (T6g) gained nothing; the entity network was parked (T5d: behind per sample, at 3.4 times
  the MLP's cost; its moves read a hex, not the stacks). The only rising curve was samples:
  `t4-2` at 50 M (no penalty) 0.839, 0.578, 0.559. The behaviour analysis (T6a): it loses mostly
  defending (0.17 in a hero battle), its targeting leaves a quarter of the previewed kills, and
  it plays the same against every opponent.
- **The search** (E06 T8; design note §14 in `E06-log.md`): Gumbel AlphaZero in Python
  (`h3env.search`) over worlds from C ABI v34 (`h3_batch_determinize`). T8c found no gain, but its
  verdict is inconclusive (T9b): a world's step scores a decided battle ±1 where the value head
  learned reward v1, and nodes below the root could take an escape (fixed). AI-STUB-1 holds the
  world's gaps.
- **The pipeline:** ADR-0026, `docs/07-simulation-and-ai.md` §1.2; about 5 000 samples/s on the
  user's machine, the network's passes dominate.

## Candidates for later increments (chosen at each checkpoint)

- **Expert iteration:** a search in Rust over determinized worlds, trained on its own choices
  (E06 design §14's T8d). Needs AI-STUB-1's gaps, the cast heads perturbed at the root, and a rule
  for the most visited action's repetitions (greedy play repeats itself, E05 T8b).
- **A network that reads the battle's structure:** E06's entity network revived from the move
  head's view of the stacks; with it `[network] order` and `preview` again.
- **Imitation** of the fair system actor (decision 3), once the battle lane has built it.
- **Scale:** the 60 M run at T7's mix (`configs/e06-t7.toml --set samples=60_000_000`, about 4
  hours; without the faithful actor now); the mana-price run (`configs/e06-mana.toml`).
- **Throughput** (E06 T5's open parts, the AI queue's inbox): the batch size and threads, the
  observations written in place, the kill preview's path searches.
- **The evaluation:** the VCMI oracle harness, if the evaluation needs it (E04's refinement).

## Non-goals

The fair system actor itself (the battle lane's); the adventure env and its AI (E13);
encounters v2; a trained network inside the engine, the server or a client; new scripted bots;
cloud compute; escapes in the reward; a new observation or action encoding, unless an increment's
evidence asks for one (then a `cross-lane` change with the battle lane, after the user's review).

## Tasks (outline; refine at the start of each increment; keep status current)

**Closed increments** (their task lists verbatim in `E25-archive.md`; the records in
`E25-log.md`):

| Increment | Closed | Tasks | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2026-10-28 | T1a–T1c, T2a, T2b, T3 | the search's terminal by reward v1 and the true world (no gain: the evaluation limits it), shaping (+0.04, a tactics-phase loop), the faithful actor out of training; C ABI v35 |
| 2 | 2026-10-29 | T4a, T4b, T5, T6 | the tactics bound (the loop gone, no cost), the scale run (flat from 20 M; `e25-scale-1` #3 the current best) |

**At increment 1's checkpoint** (the user, 2026-10-28, T3): increment 2 is shaping, bounded,
then scale; `e25-shaping-1` (#2, 20 M) was the lineage's current best; `t7-1` stays the battle
AI v1 and the baseline. **Since T4b** (the user, 2026-10-29) **`e25-bound-1`** (#2, 20 M) is the
current best; **since T6** (the user, 2026-10-29) **`e25-scale-1` #3** (30 M, three tactics
rounds), the network the exit criteria are judged on.

**Increment 3: the network's architecture** (refined 2026-10-29, AI-Q11; the AI queue's tasks).
Every run since E05 is the 2 × 512 MLP over the flat observation; the search (T1c) and scale
(T5) stopped at its limit. Candidates, all on observation v22 (no encoding change): a deeper and
a wider MLP; a **hex convolution** network (the field in axial coordinates, a 3 × 3 kernel
without two opposite corners: a hex's six neighbours); a **hex transformer** (the hexes as
tokens, a bias per axial offset); E06's entity network as it is. A distillation bench ranks them
against the current MLP before any RL run.

- [x] **T7a The network kinds** (2026-10-29; `E25-log.md` T7a): `[network] layers` for the MLP,
  `kind = "hexconv"` and `"hexformer"` (`h3env.train.hexnet`: the stacks drawn on their hexes,
  the entity network's heads, `entity.Pointed`), `field_width`, `field_height`; tests; the costs
  on the sandbox's CPU (`hexconv` 64 × 6 15 times the MLP's operations).
- [x] **T7b The distillation bench** (2026-10-29; `E25-log.md` T7b): `h3env.train.distill`,
  every student trained on the same rollouts of the teacher (`e25-scale-1` #3) to its heads and
  its λ-returns, scored on held-out rollouts per head and category; `configs/distill/e25.toml`
  (six students); a CPU smoke (minibatches of 512 rows: PPO's do not fit the hex networks).
- [x] **T7c The bench run** (2026-10-30; `E25-log.md` T7c; `records/distill/distill-1.json`):
  the structured networks fit the teacher ten times worse than any MLP (agreement 0.62 to 0.64
  against 0.87 to 0.88) at 5 to 25 times its cost; the wide MLP leads everywhere, its value past
  the teacher's (0.612 against 0.575). The user: the wide MLP alone to RL, from scratch.
- [ ] **T7d The A/B** (the user's machine, 20 M): the wide MLP (`configs/e25-wide.toml`,
  `hidden = 1024`) against `e25-scale-1`.
- [ ] **T8 Increment 3's checkpoint.**

## Exit criteria

1. The promoted agent meets decision 1's target: against the faithful system actor on the report
   set a win rate above 0.5 and a positive value efficiency; on the neutral set a value above the
   system actor's own in the player's seat; against Random, Aggressor and Greedy a win rate above
   0.5 and a positive value.
2. It plays legitimately: it reads only its side's observation (a search through ADR-0025 point
   12a's worlds), and no faithful system actor took part in its training (its run records show
   the mix).
3. Every run the epic's results cite has its record committed; E06's guarantees (config-driven,
   resumable, gated, laddered) hold for whatever E25 adds, a search in training included.
4. `cargo xtask verify` passes: CI's full verify on Linux, `--with-original-data` on Windows; the
   Python tests on both (E06's criterion 6 as amended).

## Risks

- **The target may be out of reach:** the system actor reads the whole state, an information
  advantage the agent never has (in the hero kinds; a neutral side has no hidden hero), and E06's
  six levers ended at one ladder. Revisable at a checkpoint with evidence.
- **Training without the faithful actor** changes the neutral share's signal (`t7-1` met the
  neutral target with it); T2b's control measures what it costs.
- **The search's cost:** 17 to 38 decisions a second in Python in the sandbox; expert iteration
  needs the tree in Rust.
- **The GTX 1070** (8 GB, no tensor cores): a structured network costs samples per second (E06:
  3.4 times).
- **The encounter approximation** (E05's risk) carries over.
