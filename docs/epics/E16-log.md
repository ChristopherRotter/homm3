# E16 log: done tasks in full

The full record of E16's finished milestones and tasks (what was built, agent decisions marked
provisional, measurements, the review lists). **Not start-of-session reading:** the epic file keeps
one line per done milestone; read the matching section here when a task builds on an earlier one
or a decision is questioned. Decisions live in ADR-0015 and the ADR drafts; this log only records
how and why the work went.

## Done

### M0 — The shared skeleton (2026-10-10)

- **The ADR.** The user accepted the protocol ADR draft at the checkpoint, asking for a trim
  first: 136 lines became 85, the twelve decisions unchanged; the cut text was already in the
  epic file (the measurements, the options) or the design note (§3 the manifest, §7 journals,
  §8 integrity). Numbered ADR-0015, moved to `docs/adr/` with its index row; the server lane's
  reading list in `AGENTS.md` gained it.
- **The crates.** `h3-protocol`: adapter layer, `logic = true`, the logic header, only
  `PROTOCOL_VERSION` (0 until M1 T1's first messages). `check-arch` accepted a logic crate in the
  adapter layer without a tool change (it checks purity by the `logic` flag and layers apart).
  `h3-server`: the binary `h3-server`, which prints its versions and exits 1 (SRV-STUB-1).
- **The dependencies.** The workspace gained `tokio` (`rt-multi-thread`, `net`, `time`, `sync`,
  `macros`), `tokio-tungstenite` 0.30 (`connect` only: no TLS), `futures-util` (`sink`, `std`;
  already in the graph through `tokio-tungstenite`; needed for `StreamExt`/`SinkExt` on the
  socket; *queued for the M1 review* as a light dependency), `getrandom` 0.3 (the version
  already in the lock), `postcard` (test only; *provisional*) and the path entries `h3-cli`,
  `h3-protocol`. `arch.toml` allows every edge M1 needs, so T1–T3 need no shared pull request;
  the crates declare a dependency when they use it. Checked in a throwaway worktree with all of
  them added: the build, `cargo deny check` (licences, bans, advisories, sources ok), 77 crates
  under `h3-server`, `serde_json` resolved with `alloc` only for `h3-protocol`. *Provisional:*
  `h3-server` → `h3-cli` for `load_ruleset`, `load_scenario` and `replay_to_toml`; the
  alternative is a battle-lane move of those into `h3-sim` (queued for the M1 review).
- **Docs.** The versions table (`PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `RECORD_FORMAT_VERSION` from M1,
  `JOURNAL_FORMAT_VERSION` from M2), `BACKLOG.md` E16 in progress, the global HANDOFF's server
  row, the README's crate table, `02-architecture.md`'s state paragraph, `benches/server/README.md`.
- **Found on the way.** The baseline verify on `master` failed `check-exe-map`: the adventure
  lane's E08 survey (CR-1 to CR-3) and ADV-Q3 to ADV-Q5 cite the H3API addresses of
  `GetMovementCost`, `CalcMaxMovement` and `GetScoutingRadius`, which `docs/exe/map.toml` does not
  cover; the merge was docs-only, so CI never ran on it. A map entry needs the function's size,
  which needs the executable (not staged in this session). **The user decided the adventure lane
  fixes it** (a suggested task); until then the M0 pull request's full verify is red on this
  gate only.
- **Also found.** The baseline's `test` step failed the battle property test
  `every_step_preserves_the_invariants` (a good-morale step without `HAD_MORALE` on the mover). Its
  inputs are random per run, so CI on `master` passed; the shrunk case reproduces in 5 s. Handed to
  the battle lane as a suggested task with the regression line; not committed here.
