# E24 — The adventure map client

Status: **refined** (2026-10-23, T0, with the user); **M1 closed** (2026-10-24, T6b: the
reviewers, the review list accepted by the user); **M2 refined** (2026-10-26, M2 T0, with the
user); **M2 closed** (2026-10-28, T6b2c: the user's hand test, the review list accepted at
T6b2a); **M3 refined** (2026-10-28, M3 T0, with the user); M3 T1a to T7c1 built (2026-10-28 to
2026-10-31; M3's review list accepted at T7c1); next M3 T7c2, then M4 T0
(`docs/lanes/map-client/QUEUE.md`).
Lane: map-client (`docs/lanes/map-client/HANDOFF.md`: the autonomy contract, the user's asset
notes). Opened 2026-10-23 when the user split the client lane at E17 M3's closure (CLT-Q18).
Decisions so far live here (no ADR of its own yet; ADR-0020 and ADR-0024 bind it as they bind
E17). Working detail (code readings, formats, layouts): `docs/epics/E24-design.md`, created by
the first task that has detail to record; done tasks in full: [`E24-log.md`](E24-log.md).

## Goal

The adventure map drawn with the original's own assets, truthful to the original down to the
pixel and the frame as E17's battle is: stills of a map first, then the map moving in a window,
the adventure screen around it, the engine's whole games shown, and whole games played. On E17's
foundation (the decoders `h3-assets`, the compositor `h3-render`, the SDL adapter `h3-sdl`, the
string catalogue) and its capture harness, all common paths of the two client lanes. Battles
inside a game are the battle client's (E17); this epic hands them over.

## Decisions (the user, 2026-10-23, T0; E17's binding here too)

- **E17's decisions hold** (`docs/epics/E17-clients.md`, "Decisions"): exhaustive, automated
  diffs against the original's captures (the harness under Wine, never the installation); the
  original's drawing bugs fixed and reproduced only for the comparisons (`h3_render::Bugs`); its
  redraw artifacts not copied; graphics options per effect, `faithful` the default and the only
  setting the comparisons check; asset tables per expansion, committed, identifiers and numbers
  only; loading at checkpoints, as fast as the original; every text through the string
  catalogue; **every oddity of the original an open question** (`MCL-Q<n>`, the lane HANDOFF's
  autonomy contract).
- **M1 is the map view and the screen's frame** (T0): the panels right of and below the map
  (minimap, hero and town lists, status window, resource bar, buttons) wait for M3, when the
  pieces of `h3-view` they need sit in a common crate.
- **The map moving comes before the panels** (T0): M2 the animated map in a window, M3 the
  adventure screen.
- **Test maps through `h3_map::writer`, extended by this lane** (T0): what the situations need
  and the writer lacks (rivers, a tile's pictures and flags as given, any object template) this
  lane adds to the adventure lane's writer in **additive `cross-lane` pull requests** (the
  user's consent for that kind of change, 2026-10-23), each noted in the adventure lane's inbox;
  nothing the writer writes today changes.
- **The string catalogue stays common** (T0; `clients/text/`, as T9c made it): both client
  lanes add keys.
- **A text the original sets off its centre is centred** (the user, 2026-10-31, CLT-Q28 at E17
  M5 T8c, for both client lanes: `docs/epics/E17-clients.md`, "Decisions"): in the client's
  profile the text is centred, the original's place kept for the comparisons only
  (`h3_render::Bugs`, as the cursor's x); a reading or a recording that finds such a slip fixes it
  so, with no question needed (recorded here at M3 T7c1; none found in the map client yet).

## How the viewer sees a map (T0's finding; the types since T2: `h3_map_view::art`, `live`, *provisional*)

- **Two inputs.** The engine's import (`h3_map::import`) draws nothing and keeps no pictures: no
  terrain picture, no mirror flags, no template's DEF; it imports 5 of the 160 shipped maps
  whole, and its `ObjectView`s carry no index into the map's objects. The raw map
  (`h3_map::parse` → `RawMap`) keeps all of it: each tile's terrain, river and road with their
  pictures and flags, each template's DEF, masks and priority, each object's anchor. So the
  viewer takes the **static art** from the raw `.h3m` and the **live part** (which objects stand,
  what a random object became, the owners, the heroes, what the viewer has explored, the
  moment) from a second input. In M1 that input comes from the original's memory for the
  comparisons (`h3mem.py`, an additive harness change) or from the map's start where it needs
  no draw; the engine fills it from M4 on.
- **Random objects.** The original draws a shipped map's random objects (monsters, resources,
  artifacts, towns, dwellings) when the game starts, and the harness saw them differ from run to
  run (E17 design §6.3: the piles' amounts): a comparison on such a map reads what the original
  drew from its memory, never assumes the engine's draw (T4b: each object's template in memory,
  the copy a new game made for a random one, `E24-design.md` §2.7).
- **Where the reading starts** (`docs/exe/map.toml`): each map tile keeps a draw list of the
  objects over it; `place_object_tiles` (0x505B20) adds an entry per tile of an object's
  footprint through 0x505230, `object_tile_layers` (0x505060) gives each tile a draw layer from
  the template's masks (a flat template, the special grounds, keeps layer 0), and the objects'
  shadow pass is the encoding 3 drawer 0x47D930 (E17 design §3.3). The view (T1a's reading,
  `E24-design.md` §1): eleven passes over the whole view, tile (x, y) at (32 (x − vx),
  8 + 32 (y − vy)) clipped to (8, 8)–(600, 552), the view's top-left at adventure manager +0xE4.
  The objects (T1b's reading, `E24-design.md` §2): a 32 × 32 piece per tile of each object's
  draw list, the list ordered by its cells' layers; flat objects first, then every shadow, then
  the bodies by layer with heroes and boats as two-row objects (after layers 1 and 2), then the
  path's arrows.

## Milestones

Each milestone ends at a checkpoint with the user, after a fresh reviewer agent checked it. The
autonomy contract (lane HANDOFF) says what the agent decides alone in between. Tasks: the lane's
`QUEUE.md`, each about half a context.

### M1 — stills of the map view (closed 2026-10-24)

Tasks T0 to T6b and the exit record: `E24-archive.md` (verbatim); the build record: `E24-log.md`; the design: `E24-design.md` §1, §2. The set of 40 captured situations (`clients/map/situations/`) is exact; a change to the viewer runs `h3map.py drawn` first (the runbook).

### M2 — the map moving (closed 2026-10-28)

Scope, decisions, tasks T1a1 to T6b2c and the exit record: `E24-archive.md` (verbatim); the build
record: `E24-log.md`; the design: `E24-design.md` §3. Its decisions that bind later milestones
(in the archive): the walk's path always the engine's (M4, M5), never a client pathfinder; M3
T0's common crate for both lanes, the key table moved into it; the edge scroll's 16 pixels
(MCL-Q6). The 13 recorded sequences (`clients/map/sequences.toml`, `timelines/`) are exact; a
change to the viewer runs `h3map.py drawn` first (it checks every timeline too).

### M3 — the adventure screen (closed 2026-10-31)

Scope, decisions, tasks T0 to T7c2 and the exit record: `E24-archive.md` (verbatim); the build
record: `E24-log.md`; the design: `E24-design.md` §4. Its decisions that bind later milestones
(in the archive): `h3-ui` the one crate both viewers share (the key table by context, both
windows' own keys the map's); the panels' live part `h3_map_view::live`'s, from the original's
memory in a recording and from the engine from M4; only the clicks that change the view work,
every other button showing its press (its dialog or the engine's action: M4, M5); the cursor
over the map from given inputs (the tile's contents, the path's reach), never computed by the
client; MCL-Q22's, Q24's and Q28's fixes the client's, the original's behind `--bugs original`
(MCL-Q14, Q15 and Q21's follow-ups: "Later"). The 50 situations and the 35 sequences are exact
on the whole screen; a change to the viewer runs `h3map.py drawn` first.

### Later (refined when they come)

- **M4, the engine's games shown:** a whole game's record and replay viewer; the live part from
  the engine (`h3_game`'s observation needs an object identity matching the map's object list:
  the adventure lane's inbox), the protocol's adventure messages (the server lane, E16); a battle
  handed to the battle client's viewer (CLT-Q4's background variant and CLT-Q6's colours then
  come from the map); a loaded saved game's draw lists (the objects gone before the save: not
  read, M1 T6b); the map's sound compared by ear with the original's on a whole map (the user,
  at M2 T4b2: the transitions sounded unclean, perhaps the lag's doing; the harness's recordings
  have no sound); the nine step sounds the original ships but never plays (`HORSE20` to `HORSE29`,
  perhaps the roads') as a sound option once their purpose is known (MCL-Q11); the status
  window's kinds the engine's turns and events set off (the user, 2026-10-29, at M3 T5b's cut):
  another player's turn (5: `AdStatNx.pcx`, the hourglass, 0x453250), a resource found (6:
  0x451220, 5 seconds) and a text (7: 0x451820; E24 design §4.8); a town's own name from the map
  (the harness refuses one until then); from M3's answers (T7c1): a spell cast on the map recorded
  first, then MCL-Q14's stale mana bar shown whole by the client if the original leaves it; the
  engine's resource amounts against the bar's seven digits (MCL-Q15, (b) if they can pass them);
  a map whose hints would name nothing refused at the import (MCL-Q21 (b)).
- **M5, hot seat:** whole games played in-process: the handover screen when the player who must
  act changes, the level-up dialog (the inbox), the hero and town screens as play needs them;
  then live play against the server.
- HD layouts, graphics options beyond `faithful`, video.

## Research items from the asset notes

| Item | Where |
|---|---|
| 9. The adventure map's object draw order (the user: neither they nor VCMI got it exactly right); the objects' shadows | **Closed** (T4b): M1 T1b (read, `E24-design.md` §2), T4a (its frames, §2.6), T4b (random objects, shipped maps' views, §2.7); heroes and boats among the layers since T5a (§2.8) |
| 3. Licences of MMArchive and homm3-unpacker before reading their code | stop the line: a question first, when a task wants them |
| 4. The video archives | later |
| 7. The HD patch as a source of fixes and for HD | later |

## Risks and known gaps

- **The original's moment.** A still is exact only at a known game time: whether the harness's
  virtual clock (`xdd.dll`) drives the adventure map's animations and colour cycles as it drives
  the battle's (T3b2: it does); the palette step is read from memory, the menus run in real time.
- **Random objects drawn in real time** (above): the comparisons depend on reading them from the
  original's memory.
- **The engine lags the viewer:** 5 of 160 shipped maps import whole, and the observation has no
  object identity; nothing before M4 needs either.
- **The writer belongs to another lane:** each addition is a `cross-lane` pull request; a
  situation waits for its merge.
- **Wine is not Windows** (E17's risk): a difference only Wine could cause needs a check on
  Windows.
- **The map's input without the engine** (M2): a direction key steps the hero through obstacles
  (the original's `hero_step_allowed` is the engine's rules, M5), a click shows only a path a
  recording or a situation gave (the engine's paths: M4, M5), and no step costs points (the
  walk on after a held key's release has no end but the queue's: MCL-Q10).

## Review lists

M1's review lists (three reviewers, T6b; the list accepted), M2's (accepted at T6b2a) and M3's
(six reviewers at T7, the list accepted at T7c1): `E24-archive.md`. Later milestones add theirs
here.
