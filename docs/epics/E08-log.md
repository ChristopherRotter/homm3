# E08 log: done tasks in full

The full record of E08's finished tasks (what was built, refinements, agent decisions marked
"change freely", measurements). **Not start-of-session reading:** the epic file keeps one line per
done task; read the matching section here when a task builds on an earlier one or a decision is
questioned. Rules live in the catalog, quirks in `docs/rules/quirks-adventure.md`, decisions in
ADR-0015 to ADR-0017; this log only records how and why the tasks went.

## Refinement (2026-10-07/08, with E07)

The brief's five points settled with the user: real maps first (the reader fills E07), the crate
split per context after E04b, `h3-game` from increment 1, `h3-heroes` keeps only the hero's own
state and rules, cheap forks via a wide persistent grid (quadtree rejected), the fog fringe as a
quirk candidate (faithful: objects shown; strict-fixed: terrain only), simultaneous turns
designed for, not built (turn groups, per-player server-only RNG streams, no blocking prompts; the
commutation target captured, its decision deferred). Review with the user (PR #21): the hero crate
keeps `derive_battle_hero`/`war_machines`; T1 split into T1a and T1b; four crates (no
`h3-content-adventure`); added the import boundary and setup types, the leavable own tile, map
input bounds and the missing fuzz harness, the two copy-on-write properties, the viewer knowledge
list, adventure sub-paths in battle's crates, the versions rows, `docs/formats/h3m.md` to
adventure, the C ABI non-goal, E09/E10's residual scope, exit criteria, the fringe's confirmation.

## Done tasks

### T1a — Three ADR drafts (2026-10-09, PR #32; accepted 2026-10-10)

Written from decisions 2–9 as they stood; no code. A fresh reviewer agent checked them against the
epic, the ADRs and the server lane's draft; its findings were folded in. New beyond the epic, each
flagged for the review: per-object state in a persistent chunked table and `check-arch` tokens
against pointer identity; two visiting modes (entering, or from a neighbouring tile) and heroes
blocking in increment 1; visibility resolved at emission; the import's three stages with setup
types owned by their validators; `Actor::System` and `Viewer::Spectator` as additive shapes
(SRV-Q6), a setup stream, a battle with another player's hero owned by both players, an
inventory of state two players can write. Deferred to increment 3 with the server lane: where a
battle's seed and obstacles come from.

**Checkpoint (2026-10-10):** the user read a one-screen summary per draft (the new points marked)
and accepted all three as written: ADR-0015, ADR-0016, ADR-0017. ADV-Q1: ids in `h3-contracts`.
ADV-Q2: a replay names its map by content hash and path plus the import version.

### T1b — Survey of movement, fog of war, the day and simultaneous turns (2026-10-09, PR #33)

Sources: VCMI 1.7.5, the wiki's Movement and Scouting pages (approved for that session), the
executable's tables already mapped, the HD mod's page. No code reading: the disputes name the
function to read (CR-1 step cost, CR-2 a day's points, CR-3 the reveal), queued as the first step
of T7, T6/T7 and T8 (`ADV-Q3`–`ADV-Q5`). Findings that touch the ADRs: a path may use explored
tiles only (VCMI; question 4 of the user's map check), so the action mask cannot leak; every
increment-1 rule runs at the start of the day; increment 1 has no owned objects, so a game opens
with only the heroes' surroundings explored (a recorded simplification). VCMI's contact rule for
simultaneous turns (reachability at the start of the day) is the recommended model for later.

**Classification (2026-10-10):** the user classifies A-2 and A-3 after T7's code reading; A-1
waits for the user's look at a map (four questions in the survey's §4), needed by T8 only. Rule
ids of the game context use the existing prefix `GAM-` (`check-rules`), not `GAME-` as the survey
proposed.

### T2 — Shared skeleton (2026-10-10, `shared/adventure-skeleton`, `cross-lane`)

One pull request with the user's consent: the new adventure crates' skeletons must land with the
workspace members and `arch.toml`, and `check-lane` refuses lane and shared paths together
without the label.

- **Crates:** `h3-adventure` (domain) and `h3-game` (application) as logic crates with the lint
  header and their hash-version constants; `h3-map` (with `MAP_IMPORT_VERSION`) and
  `h3-pack-adventure` as adapters, doc-only. No code, so no coverage yet.
- **`arch.toml`:** the four crates' edges; `h3-sim` may depend on `h3-adventure` and `h3-game`
  (dev: `h3-map`, `h3-pack-adventure`), `h3-cli` on all four, so T9 needs no shared change;
  `h3-map`'s dev-dependencies on the two pack adapters build test rulesets; `ptr_eq` and `as_ptr`
  are forbidden in logic crates outside `crates/h3-adventure/src/persistent.rs` (T5's module;
  agent decision, change freely: renaming it is a shared change).
- **`h3-contracts`:** `PlayerId(u8)` (position in the game's player list, colour order) and
  `HeroId(u16)` (position in the game's store of heroes), opaque with `new`/`raw`/`index`; no
  canonical-hash impls (the state hashes feed `raw()`).
- **`h3-kernel`:** `StreamId::GAME` (4), `SETUP` (5) and `player(i)` = 0x100 + i; KER-RNG-001
  lists the ids. No existing sequence changes, so `RNG_VERSION` stays 1.
- **`lanes.toml`:** the new crates, `src/adventure/` of `h3-sim` and `h3-cli`,
  `crates/h3-cli/tests/adventure_replays.rs`, `fixtures/replays/adventure/`, `fixtures/maps/`,
  each pack's `adventure.toml`, `docs/formats/h3m.md` (moved from battle, user consent) and
  `docs/rules/catalog/game.toml` to adventure; the survey index is a common path.
- **`xtask`:** `verify --scope` runs the determinism step for a lane that owns `h3-cli` or a
  non-empty replay folder of its own; `cargo xtask determinism` re-runs every existing replay test
  target of `h3-cli` (`replay_fixtures`, and `adventure_replays` once T9 adds it).
- **Executable map:** `check-exe-map` had failed on `master` since T1b's PR #33 (docs only, so
  CI never ran it): the survey cites H3API's `GetMovementCost`, `GetScoutingRadius`,
  `MaxLandMovement` and `CalcMaxMovement` (0x4B18C0, 0x4E4070, 0x4E4990, 0x4E4D90). Added as
  `guess` entries with the sizes from `scripts/exe.py check --fix-sizes`; T6–T8 read them.
- **Fuzzing:** the user chose stable-only for now: parsers of untrusted input are property-tested
  on arbitrary bytes; `cargo-fuzz` needs nightly, which the sandbox cannot download (BACKLOG
  inbox).
- **Docs:** the versions table (game state hash, adventure state and ruleset-part hashes, map
  import, adventure replay format), lane ownership in `docs/08`, `BACKLOG.md` (E07 folded into
  E08, E08 in progress, E09/E10 restated, R01 the content split), the global HANDOFF's adventure
  row, ADR-0005/0006 amendments, `docs/02` §3 and `docs/03` (Game row, terms, the object question
  answered).
