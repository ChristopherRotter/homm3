# E08 log: done tasks in full

The full record of E08's finished tasks (what was built, refinements, agent decisions marked
"change freely", measurements). **Not start-of-session reading:** the epic file keeps one line per
done task; read the matching section here when a task builds on an earlier one or a decision is
questioned. Rules live in the catalog, quirks in `docs/rules/quirks-adventure.md`, decisions in
ADR-0015 to ADR-0017; this log only records how and why the tasks went.

## Refinement (2026-10-07/08, with E07)

The brief's five points settled with the user: real maps first (the reader fills E07), the crate
split per context after E04b, `h3-game` from increment 1, `h3-heroes` keeps only the hero's own
state and rules, cheap forks via a wide persistent grid (quadtree rejected), the fog fringe as a
quirk candidate (faithful: objects shown; strict-fixed: terrain only), simultaneous turns
designed for, not built (turn groups, per-player server-only RNG streams, no blocking prompts; the
commutation target captured, its decision deferred). Review with the user (PR #21): the hero crate
keeps `derive_battle_hero`/`war_machines`; T1 split into T1a and T1b; four crates (no
`h3-content-adventure`); added the import boundary and setup types, the leavable own tile, map
input bounds and the missing fuzz harness, the two copy-on-write properties, the viewer knowledge
list, adventure sub-paths in battle's crates, the versions rows, `docs/formats/h3m.md` to
adventure, the C ABI non-goal, E09/E10's residual scope, exit criteria, the fringe's confirmation.

## Done tasks

### T1a — Three ADR drafts (2026-10-09, PR #32; accepted 2026-10-10)

Written from decisions 2–9 as they stood; no code. A fresh reviewer agent checked them against the
epic, the ADRs and the server lane's draft; its findings were folded in. New beyond the epic, each
flagged for the review: per-object state in a persistent chunked table and `check-arch` tokens
against pointer identity; two visiting modes (entering, or from a neighbouring tile) and heroes
blocking in increment 1; visibility resolved at emission; the import's three stages with setup
types owned by their validators; `Actor::System` and `Viewer::Spectator` as additive shapes
(SRV-Q6), a setup stream, a battle with another player's hero owned by both players, an
inventory of state two players can write. Deferred to increment 3 with the server lane: where a
battle's seed and obstacles come from.

**Checkpoint (2026-10-10):** the user read a one-screen summary per draft (the new points marked)
and accepted all three as written: ADR-0015, ADR-0016, ADR-0017. ADV-Q1: ids in `h3-contracts`.
ADV-Q2: a replay names its map by content hash and path plus the import version.

### T1b — Survey of movement, fog of war, the day and simultaneous turns (2026-10-09, PR #33)

Sources: VCMI 1.7.5, the wiki's Movement and Scouting pages (approved for that session), the
executable's tables already mapped, the HD mod's page. No code reading: the disputes name the
function to read (CR-1 step cost, CR-2 a day's points, CR-3 the reveal), queued as the first step
of T7, T6/T7 and T8 (`ADV-Q3`–`ADV-Q5`). Findings that touch the ADRs: a path may use explored
tiles only (VCMI; question 4 of the user's map check), so the action mask cannot leak; every
increment-1 rule runs at the start of the day; increment 1 has no owned objects, so a game opens
with only the heroes' surroundings explored (a recorded simplification). VCMI's contact rule for
simultaneous turns (reachability at the start of the day) is the recommended model for later.

**Classification (2026-10-10):** the user classifies A-2 and A-3 after T7's code reading; A-1
waits for the user's look at a map (four questions in the survey's §4), needed by T8 only. Rule
ids of the game context use the existing prefix `GAM-` (`check-rules`), not `GAME-` as the survey
proposed.

### T2 — Shared skeleton (2026-10-10, `shared/adventure-skeleton`, `cross-lane`)

One pull request with the user's consent: the new adventure crates' skeletons must land with the
workspace members and `arch.toml`, and `check-lane` refuses lane and shared paths together
without the label.

- **Crates:** `h3-adventure` (domain) and `h3-game` (application) as logic crates with the lint
  header and their hash-version constants; `h3-map` (with `MAP_IMPORT_VERSION`) and
  `h3-pack-adventure` as adapters, doc-only. No code, so no coverage yet.
- **`arch.toml`:** the four crates' edges; `h3-sim` may depend on `h3-adventure` and `h3-game`
  (dev: `h3-map`, `h3-pack-adventure`), `h3-cli` on all four, so T9 needs no shared change;
  `h3-map`'s dev-dependencies on the two pack adapters build test rulesets; `ptr_eq` and `as_ptr`
  are forbidden in logic crates outside `crates/h3-adventure/src/persistent.rs` (T5's module;
  agent decision, change freely: renaming it is a shared change).
- **`h3-contracts`:** `PlayerId(u8)` (position in the game's player list, colour order) and
  `HeroId(u16)` (position in the game's store of heroes), opaque with `new`/`raw`/`index`; no
  canonical-hash impls (the state hashes feed `raw()`).
- **`h3-kernel`:** `StreamId::GAME` (4), `SETUP` (5) and `player(i)` = 0x100 + i; KER-RNG-001
  lists the ids. No existing sequence changes, so `RNG_VERSION` stays 1.
- **`lanes.toml`:** the new crates, `src/adventure/` of `h3-sim` and `h3-cli`,
  `crates/h3-cli/tests/adventure_replays.rs`, `fixtures/replays/adventure/`, `fixtures/maps/`,
  each pack's `adventure.toml`, `docs/formats/h3m.md` (moved from battle, user consent) and
  `docs/rules/catalog/game.toml` to adventure; the survey index is a common path.
- **`xtask`:** `verify --scope` runs the determinism step for a lane that owns `h3-cli` or a
  non-empty replay folder of its own; `cargo xtask determinism` re-runs every existing replay test
  target of `h3-cli` (`replay_fixtures`, and `adventure_replays` once T9 adds it).
- **Executable map:** `check-exe-map` had failed on `master` since T1b's PR #33 (docs only, so
  CI never ran it): the survey cites H3API's `GetMovementCost`, `GetScoutingRadius`,
  `MaxLandMovement` and `CalcMaxMovement` (0x4B18C0, 0x4E4070, 0x4E4990, 0x4E4D90). Added as
  `guess` entries with the sizes from `scripts/exe.py check --fix-sizes`; T6–T8 read them.
- **Fuzzing:** the user chose stable-only for now: parsers of untrusted input are property-tested
  on arbitrary bytes; `cargo-fuzz` needs nightly, which the sandbox cannot download (BACKLOG
  inbox).
- **Docs:** the versions table (game state hash, adventure state and ruleset-part hashes, map
  import, adventure replay format), lane ownership in `docs/08`, `BACKLOG.md` (E07 folded into
  E08, E08 in progress, E09/E10 restated, R01 the content split), the global HANDOFF's adventure
  row, ADR-0005/0006 amendments, `docs/02` §3 and `docs/03` (Game row, terms, the object question
  answered).

### T3a — Map reader up to the terrain (2026-10-10, `adventure/e08-t3`, after `shared/h3m-reader-gate`)

The seam agreed with the user at the start: T3 builds only the reader (T3a to the terrain, T3b the
templates, objects and events, then a checkpoint); the import moves to T5 (`AdventureSetup`:
terrain, roads, rivers, footprints) and T6 (`GameSetup`: players, placed heroes, `Unsupported`,
`MAP_IMPORT_VERSION` documented, and the arbitrary-bytes property over parse, import and
validation together), because the setup types are best shaped with the validators that own them.

- **Shared prerequisite** (`shared/h3m-reader-gate`, PR #48, merged first): `h3-map` may use
  `miniz_oxide` and, in tests, `h3-formats`; `verify --with-original-data` runs every crate's
  `examples/original_data.rs` with the installation path (a crate adds one without a shared
  change); the sandbox setup copies staged maps. The user had the installation's `Maps` copied
  into `original-data/install/Maps` (164 files, compared byte for byte; the installation itself
  only read).
- **API:** `read(file, &Limits)` (bounded gzip, then `parse`), `parse(bytes, &Limits)`,
  `gunzip`, `crc32`, `Limits` (defaults in `docs/formats/h3m.md`), `ReadError` (file too large,
  not gzip, map too large, checksum, unsupported version, truncated, limit exceeded, invalid
  value; field and offset each), `model::RawMap` and its parts. Agent decisions, change freely:
  codes stay raw numbers (terrain, hero types, artifacts) and only layout-deciding values are
  checked (condition kinds, the map size); strings stay bytes (`Text`; other language editions
  use other code pages); bit sets stay bytes (`Bits`); unused bytes are skipped, not kept.
- **gzip:** RFC 1952 header with its optional fields, `miniz_oxide`'s limited inflate, the
  trailer's CRC-32 (own table, check value `CBF43926`) and length must match; a multi-member file
  fails the checksum.
- **Bounds:** every count is checked against its limit and against the bytes left
  (`count × smallest record`), so a hostile count is `Truncated` before any allocation.
- **Tests:** a test-only encoder (the inverse of `parse`) and strategies for every model a version
  can hold; properties: round trip, every strict prefix is `Truncated`, arbitrary bytes after a
  version and mutated maps never panic, the gzip layer reads back and fails cleanly; unit tests for
  each error and limit, the gzip header fields, and a map of the experiment writer read back. The
  strategies are boxed: unboxed, the value tree overflowed the test thread's stack in debug.
- **Shipped maps:** all 164 read to the end of the terrain with every tile code in range on the
  first run (50 RoE, 55 AB, 59 SoD); the peaks set the bounds' table. `Battle of the Sexes
  Allied` customises 130 hero types and restricts 130.
- **Stub:** ADV-STUB-1, the reader stopped after the terrain (removed by T3b).

### T3b — Map reader: templates, objects, events (2026-10-10, `adventure/e08-t3`, after T3a)

- **Model:** `model::Template`, `Object` (position, template index, `Body`), and `Body` with one
  variant per body the format tells apart by class (and, for mines and the grail, subclass): event,
  hero (also prison and random hero), monster, sign, seer hut, witch hut, scholar, garrison,
  artifact, scroll, resource, town, mine, abandoned mine, owned (dwellings, lighthouse, shipyard),
  random dwelling, shrine, Pandora's box, grail, quest guard, hero placeholder, none. Parts:
  `Army`, `Stack`, `Message`, `Rewards`, `Quest`, `Mission`, `Reward`, `TownBody`, `Buildings`,
  `TimedEvent`, `TownEvent`, `RandomDwelling`. Agent decisions, change freely: RoE's seer hut
  quest is modelled as an artifact mission without deadline or texts (VCMI's reading); an empty army
  slot drops its stored count.
- **Findings on the shipped maps:** every map ends with 124 zero bytes after the timed events, so
  the reader accepts zero padding and rejects anything else (`TrailingBytes`); a town's banned-spell
  set is stored in every version (only the required set is AB's), which a filtered first reading of
  VCMI's reader missed and all 50 RoE maps exposed. All 164 maps then read to their padding;
  every body kind but the campaign hero placeholder occurs (peaks and counts in
  `docs/formats/h3m.md`).
- **Bounds:** templates 4 096, objects 65 536, timed events 1 024 (map or town); the string limit
  stays 64 KiB (peak 1 314).
- **Tests:** the encoder and strategies cover every body (strategies pick a template class per
  body, then a body that fits it); unit tests for an object naming a missing template, unknown
  quest and reward codes, the new limits, every mission and reward, and the experiment writer's
  map with a hero and a monster read back.
- **Not done:** `fixtures/maps/` waits for the user's editor maps (QUEUE inbox).
