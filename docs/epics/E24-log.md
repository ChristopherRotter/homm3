# E24 log: done tasks in full

The full record of E24's finished milestones and tasks (what was built, agent decisions marked
provisional, measurements, the review lists). **Not start-of-session reading:** the epic file
keeps one line per done task; read the matching section here when a task builds on an earlier
one or a decision is questioned.

## Done

### T0 — E24 refined with the user (2026-10-23)

One session, the user present; branch `map-client/e24-t0` (docs only, `cross-lane` for the
BACKLOG row, the user's consent). The agent read the lane's docs, `clients/README.md`, E17's epic
file and design notes §6.3 (the harness on the adventure map), `h3-map`'s raw model and import,
the executable map's adventure entries, and the adventure lane's state; it proposed the
milestones and M1's tasks, and the user took every recommendation:

- **M1's scope:** the map view and the screen's frame; the panels in M3 (over the whole
  adventure screen in M1).
- **The order:** the map moving (M2) before the panels (M3).
- **Test maps:** this lane adds what it needs to `h3_map::writer` in additive `cross-lane` pull
  requests (over the adventure lane's inbox or a writer of the lane's own).
- **The string catalogue** stays common (T9c's call, confirmed).
- **The BACKLOG row** in this pull request, `cross-lane` (over a `shared/` one).

What shaped the proposal (the epic file's "How the viewer sees a map" keeps the result):

- `h3_map::import` keeps no pictures and imports 5 of the 160 shipped maps whole; `RawMap` keeps
  every tile's terrain, river and road with their pictures and flags (`model::Tile`) and every
  template's DEF, masks, class, group and priority (`model::objects::Template`): the static art
  comes from the raw map, the live part from a second input.
- The writer has terrain patches (whole rectangles, so the transitions are whatever pictures it
  writes), straight roads (pictures 15, 12, 13), heroes, monsters, piles, grounds, plain objects
  of `PLAIN_OBJECTS`' five classes (the Cartographers, three kinds of trees, the Border Gates),
  towns and an underground level; no rivers, no free tile pictures, no other templates.
- The executable map already names the per-tile draw lists (0x505B20, 0x505230, 0x505060) and the
  shadow pass (0x47D930); the harness knows the view's geometry and its top-left in memory.
- A shipped map's random objects are drawn at the game's start in real time (E17 design §6.3).

Inbox notes written: the adventure lane's (the writer's additions to come; the object identity
M4 needs), the client lane's (the common crate M3 needs).
