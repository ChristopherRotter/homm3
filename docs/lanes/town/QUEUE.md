# Town lane — QUEUE

Pre-refined tasks of the town lane, in order, then the inbox of discovered work. The task format, the runner/worker model and the `in progress` mark: `docs/08-work-process.md`, "Queues and long runs".

## Tasks

Epic: `docs/epics/E09-towns.md` (increment 3: growth, recruitment and the army rows, refined at
T20, `TWN-Q11`, decisions 64 to 67); done tasks in `E09-log.md`; increments 1 and 2 (closed by T10
and T20) in `E09-archive.md`. Increment 3's first round (decision 66): the survey T21 and its
checkpoint (done 2026-11-11, `TWN-Q12`), then the drafts with the design note's Part E and the
cut T22, accepted before anything is built. Each task's cut confirmed at its start; every entry's acceptance includes the
Definition of Done (`docs/05-testing.md`).

**E09 T22 — increment 3's drafts, the design note's Part E and the cut** (decision 66; queued
2026-11-11 by T20, its input since T21): from the survey `docs/rules/surveys/E09-growth.md` and
its checkpoint (`TWN-Q12`, decisions 69 to 73: two `fix-optional` quirks, T-13 and T-12, with
their flags; the Portal drawn at its build and a dwelling flagged; T-10's saturating counts), the
ADR amendment drafts (ADR-0028, ADR-0017 point 4's week's creature stream, and the others the
survey touches: the army reference, a garrison hero at a siege) in `adr-drafts/`, Part E of `E09-design.md` from §37, the building tasks' cut and the exit criteria,
batch TWN-3's runs (survey §14), accepted by the user at the checkpoint (`TWN-Q13` on). **Before
drafting:** the army reference agreed with the adventure lane (its inbox, T21's note of
2026-11-11; its T108b drafts the map's garrisons). **At its start:** confirm the cut. **Status:**
next.

## Inbox

Notes from earlier work for E09, gathered at the lane's opening (2026-10-31, T0); each points to
where the detail is (grep the date or id in the adventure lane's `QUEUE-ARCHIVE.md` or `QUEUE.md`).

- 2026-11-10 (the adventure lane, E08 T105b2, `adventure/e08-t105b2`, `cross-lane`; **a town's
  revisit, for your visit**; increment 11's design note §13): `AdventureCommand::Revisit { hero }`
  (ADV-TEL-008) visits the entered object under a hero again as a step's last step onto it would,
  no points, no step, no guard test: for a hero standing on its own town's entrance that is
  `visit_town` with `Visit::Enter` (`town_visit` as it stands), at 0 points too and as often as
  the player likes. `legal_commands` lists it for every such hero after the `BuildBoat`s (and
  before a town's builds once T18b2 lists them: `revisitable`'s place is after `buildable_shipyards`
  in `h3-game`'s `legal.rs`). Whatever a town's visit opens later (its screen, a garrison
  exchange) opens at a revisit too; nothing moved in your hashes. The replay format is v12
  (`revisit <hero>`): a town bump of the format is v13.

- 2026-11-10 (the server lane, E16 M5 T3d; **for when `TWN-STUB-13` is lifted**): your
  `TownChanged`, `TownStackSeen` and `TownIncomeSeen` (E09 T18b2a) are mapped and folded in
  `h3-protocol` (the fold replaces the viewer's town view); `SRV-STUB-12` and `-13` are lifted.
  The fold gate (`h3-protocol`'s `tests/game_fold.rs`, the 55 golden replays) now exempts the
  garrisons and the town owner facts only for a reveal and for `TWN-STUB-13` (3 viewer-commands:
  another team's town falling from level 3 to 2 as a Visions holder's reach is lost). Once
  Visions' reach is told, the gate fails with "lift [...] from it": drop `VISIONS` from those two
  parts in the same pull request (`cross-lane`), as a new event field or variant is mapped there
  (the global trap). This note replaces the server lane's of 2026-11-09 (T3c2).
- 2026-11-09 (the adventure lane, E08 T105a1, `adventure/e08-t105a1`; **a signature, for your
  callers**; increment 11's design note §13, §18): `AdventureState::apply` takes `(player, draws)`
  in place of `player` (`draws: &mut Rng`, the acting player's stream: a visit's draw, a
  monolith's exit, comes from it) and `visit_held` takes `draws` before the sink; the game passes
  them from `GameState::adventure_for(player)` (the adventure state, the store of heroes and that
  player's stream). Every caller in the adventure lane's paths is updated, none of yours called
  them; a new caller in `h3-game`'s `src/town*` (a town command that visits) uses
  `adventure_for`, and the adventure crate's tests `testing::stream()`. Nothing moved in a hash.
- 2026-11-05 (the adventure lane, E08 T97a, `adventure/e08-t97a`; **for the week's creature,
  increment 3**): the map's dwellings and Refugee Camps ignore the week's and the month's kind
  (ADV-DWL-003: the original's `dwelling_week_refill` 0x4B8A60 reads neither; survey
  `E08-dwellings.md` §6.1). The month's side is tested (`h3-game`'s
  `a_month_s_kind_never_reaches_a_dwelling_or_a_camp`: a Plague and a creature month); the week's
  creature is not drawn yet. When it lands, extend that test with a week of the hut's creature:
  the hut's and the camp's counts stay at their growth.
- 2026-11-05 (the adventure lane, E08 T95b, `adventure/e08-t95b`; **for a town's recruitment,
  E09 decision 4**): the hire dialog is built to be reused (increment 10's design note §13,
  "E09's reuse"). `h3_adventure::HireDialog { target: HireTarget, source: HireSource }`: extend
  `HireSource` with a town's dwelling and `HireTarget` with the garrison; the map's purchase rule
  stays one (`AdventureState::hire_stock`, `hire_room`, `check_hire` → `HirePurchase`, `hire`;
  ADV-HIR-002), and so does the game's decision (`h3-game`'s `state/hire.rs`: `Decision::Hire`,
  `Answer::Hire(HireAnswer::{Buy, Close})`, the legal set of each creature's most, `hire_range`,
  `DecisionView::Hire`, `GameState::hire_dialog`; GAM-DEC-008). The env's four purchases (action
  encoding v7) take the source's order, so a town's dwelling of up to four creatures needs no
  new entry. Game state hash v25 is T95b's.
- 2026-11-04 (the adventure lane, E08 T94b, `adventure/e08-t94b`; **for the towns' external
  dwellings' growth**; its versions half done by E09 T8a1, v21): A dwelling's counts and guards as
  they stand:
  `AdventureState::dwelling_counts` and `dwelling_guards` (by object index; none of a block while
  every dwelling is as its week began); the week's refill of every dwelling is the first step of
  `AdventureState::start_week`, before the weekly objects and the camps, reading no week's or
  month's kind (ADV-DWL-003; your towns' growth is separate, survey `E08-dwellings.md` §6.1).
- 2026-11-04 (the adventure lane, E08 T94a, `adventure/e08-t94a`; **for the towns' external
  dwellings' growth**, E09 survey §8.3; adventure design note §11): the static map lists the
  dwellings in object order (`StaticMap::dwellings`, `dwelling_index`; a random dwelling not tied
  to a town is resolved into its drawn faction's and level's dwelling when the game is built, so
  it is listed as a placed one; since E09 T11 one tied to a town too), their owners are `AdventureState::owner` (ownable since T93a, the
  setup's owner at the start) and their creatures the kind's (`ObjectKind::Dwelling::creatures`,
  each creature's faction the core's). Their counts and guards come with T94b (adventure state hash
  v20). A random dwelling tied to a town resolves since E09 T11, after the towns' draws (ADR-0017
  point 4).
- 2026-11-04 (the client lane, E17 M6 T3c3, `client/e17-m6-t3c3`; **when you change
  `h3-towns`' or `h3-pack-towns`' public API**): the battle client's binary now compiles the packs'
  town part (`h3_pack_towns::compile`) and reads `TownRuleset::town`, `TownRecord::building` and
  `buildings`, `Building::key` and `slot` and `BuildingId::from_index` (a siege's buildings and a
  Grail building by key in the stats dialog, the original's map by slot; design E17 §12.11). CI's
  clients job watches both crates (#704): a change there runs `clients/scripts/check.sh`, locally
  `scripts/verify-once.sh clients --base origin/master`; a dependency change updates
  `clients/Cargo.lock`.
- 2026-11-03 (the battle lane, CLT-Q40; its siege half done by T6b, `QUEUE-ARCHIVE.md`): the
  owner's Grail building that adds a hero's morale or luck (the Colossus, the Spirit Guardian)
  names itself as `EffectSource::Building { faction, index }` on that hero's `BattleEffect`, when
  the game gives it.
- 2026-11-03 (the adventure lane, E08 T87c, ADV-Q41; **for your increment 3's recruitment, nothing
  to build now**): E08's increment 10 is dwellings and hiring (decision 231): the map's creature
  dwellings (17, 20), the random dwellings with a faction set and the Refugee Camp, their weekly
  creatures and **the hire dialog**, built in the adventure lane first (E09 decision 4); the random
  dwellings tied to a random town resolve since E09 T11. Its survey (T88a,
  `docs/rules/surveys/E08-dwellings.md`) and design note (T88b) come first; this lane's inbox is
  told when the hire dialog lands.
- (adventure archive, 2026-10-03, E04a T3a) Not harvested: the spells' town chances and the hero
  classes' tavern weights (RoE lacks the Conflux column: an override kind or a per-faction table).
  Increment 4, the Tavern (weights: only the tavern's draw reads them, survey `E09-towns.md`
  §4.4), increment 5 (chances).
- (adventure queue, 2026-10-20, T24a2b1) `Marshland Menace` gives 15 hero types a map-wide
  experience of 2 000 that only its taverns reach. Increment 4, the Tavern.
- (ADR-0017 point 4; E08 decision 197) The week's creature, drawn from a stream of its own, and the
  Plague's effect on towns. Increment 3.
- (`ADV-STUB-9`, E10's) A Tavern town to hire a retreated hero again: a fact of the battle's
  retreat setup. Increment 4, the Tavern, with E10.
- (ADR-0013 point 13.6; E08 decision 199, A-30) The Castle's Lighthouse building (sea movement).
  Increment 5.
- (adventure archive, 2026-10-14, T19a2b) The Necropolis buildings' +10/+20 % Necromancy
  (0x4E3CD0 with the building bits 0x66CE40, 0x66CE68). Increment 5.
- (adventure archive, 2026-10-03, E04a T3b) Combination artifacts' costs (blank in the original):
  the Artifact Merchants. Increment 5.
- (adventure archive, 2026-10-11, T8a; T34b) The new day's reveal around owned objects after a
  Cover of Darkness hid tiles (0x4C7BA0). Increment 5.
