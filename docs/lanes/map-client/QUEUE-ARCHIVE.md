# Map client lane — QUEUE archive

Finished history and informational notices moved out of `QUEUE.md` on 2026-10-24, verbatim, so that the queue holds only what is open. Nothing here is a task. Grep it when a doc, a decision or a commit cites an entry (`git grep -n 'T21b' docs/lanes/map-client/QUEUE-ARCHIVE.md`). New finished items are appended at the top of their section.

## Notices from other lanes and finished items, newest first

- 2026-10-24 (this lane, E24 M1 T6b's reviewer, R2-8; with the next writer pull request): the
  writer's edge bound for an object (`crates/h3-map/src/writer/extras.rs` `PAST_RIGHT`, `PAST_BOTTOM`, its test
  at 799) lets an anchor lie 7 past the map's side, where an 8-wide template covers no cell on
  the map: one too generous, its comment off by one (6 and 4, or the comment). The adventure
  lane's crate: a `cross-lane` change, so it waits for the next addition the situations need.
  *Done 2026-10-27 (E24 M2 T6b1): #523.*

- 2026-10-23 (the adventure lane, E08 T47a; for information, nothing to do): the harness's
  clicks and reads for batch E6 (`clients/capture/README.md`, "Screens and their items"): the
  screen showing is the topmost dialog's kind by its vtable (`h3mem.dialog`), and a click finds
  its item by id among the dialog's items in memory, which now carry their boxes, states and texts
  (`h3mem.dialog_items`; `dialog_text` shares `item_text`); the hero screen, exchange, army,
  creature and split dialogs' items by name (`h3adv.SCREEN_ITEMS`); a step's `screen = "hero"`
  and `actions`; a battle's tactics phase ended at once in `fight` (its message's OK, then Start).
  The harness check gained Kit and Full (Blue's eight heroes): passed under Wine.
