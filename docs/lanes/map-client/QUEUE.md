# Map client lane — QUEUE

Pre-refined tasks of the map client lane, in order, then the inbox of discovered work. The task format, the runner/worker model and the `in progress` mark: `docs/08-work-process.md`, "Queues and long runs".

## Tasks

Epic: E24, the adventure map client, **M1: stills of the map view** (refined 2026-10-23, T0;
`docs/epics/E24-map-client.md`: the decisions, how the viewer sees a map, the milestones). Code
readings in the sandbox (`docs/exe/README.md`; every address cited needs a map entry), their
detail in `docs/epics/E24-design.md`; captures by the harness (`clients/capture/README.md`), never
in git. Every oddity of the original a reading or a capture finds is an `MCL-Q<n>` in the same
task (the HANDOFF's autonomy contract).

### E24 M1 T5 — heroes, boats, flags, owners and the path's arrows

- **Scope:** a reading where T1a and T1b did not cover it (a hero's map DEF by class, its group by
  facing, its frame at rest, its flag by colour, boats, an owned object's colours: mines,
  dwellings, towns, the eight classes' flag pixels, D10), the tables' entries; heroes and boats
  as two-row objects among the objects' layers (§2.2, §2.3: D4, D5; from T4 with the user's
  split), the path's arrows and their shadows (passes 6 and 8, D9; from T4); the unexplored tiles
  from the original's explored tiles (`h3mem.py`) in the live part; situations of heroes of every
  class facing each way, of a hero beside an object's blocked cell and two heroes side by side, of
  boats (D6, D7), of a path under an object, and of owned objects of every colour.
- **Acceptance:** those situations match pixel for pixel outside the panels' masks.
- **Depends on:** T4a, T4b (done). **Status:** ready. Shipped maps load whole since T4b
  (`map`): their heroes and owned objects are T5's to draw; a town's picture follows its
  buildings through the same copy as a random object's (0x4C9990, `E24-design.md` §2.7).

### E24 M1 T6 — the capture set and M1's closure

- **Scope:** the map's capture set (`clients/map/situations/`, started by T3b2 with `set.toml`
  and `h3map.py set`: every situation of T3b2 to T5 with
  its masks) and its digests, so a later task captures only what it changes (as E17's `drawn`,
  the runbook's "Which captures a change needs"); M1's closure: a fresh reviewer agent, its
  findings fixed or queued, the review list (the epic's), the user's checkpoint; M2 T0 queued.
- **Acceptance:** the whole set matches as recorded; the review list accepted by the user.
- **Depends on:** T5. **Status:** waiting (T5).

## Inbox

Other lanes add entries here. The map client lane turns each into a task, or keeps one line here
while the work waits.

- 2026-10-23 (the client lane, E17 M3 T9c, at the split): moved here from the client lane's
  inbox, the adventure lane's entry of 2026-10-21 (E08 T30, decision 65, ADR-0017 point 6 amended
  in #353; for the hot-seat client, E24 M5): **a level-up holds the game.**
  While a hero's level-up with two offers is open, the engine accepts no command but its owner's
  answer (`h3_game::GameState::waiting_for` names the owner; `level_up(owner)`, or the owner's
  `GameObservation.decision` as `DecisionView::LevelUp`, gives the hero, level, primary skill and
  the two offers; `Answer::First`/`Second` answer it). A battle's defender that won answers it
  outside its turn. The user's requirement for hot seat: when the player who must act changes,
  show a handover screen that hides everything (map, hero list, the dialog) until that player
  confirms it is in control, then the level-up dialog alone, and hand back to the player whose
  turn runs the same way, so no one sees another player's view.
