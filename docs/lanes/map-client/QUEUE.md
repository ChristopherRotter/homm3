# Map client lane — QUEUE

Pre-refined tasks of the map client lane, in order, then the inbox of discovered work. The task format, the runner/worker model and the `in progress` mark: `docs/08-work-process.md`, "Queues and long runs".

## Tasks

Epic: E24, the adventure map client. **M1 (stills of the map view) closed 2026-10-24** (T6b,
the review list accepted by the user); next **M2: the map moving**, refined in its T0
(`docs/epics/E24-map-client.md`: the decisions, how the viewer sees a map, the milestones). Code
readings in the sandbox (`docs/exe/README.md`; every address cited needs a map entry), their
detail in `docs/epics/E24-design.md`; captures by the harness (`clients/capture/README.md`), never
in git. Every oddity of the original a reading or a capture finds is an `MCL-Q<n>` in the same
task (the HANDOFF's autonomy contract).

### E24 M2 T0 — M2 refined with the user

- **Scope:** the epic's "M2 — the map moving" refined with the user: the objects' animations and
  the palette cycles over time, the view scrolling, a hero's walk along its path (the arrows from
  a path, T5b2's review item), in a window at the original's frame times (`h3-sdl`), checked frame
  by frame against recorded sequences as E17 M2 did (its `frames` and sequences). With the user:
  the readings first (the walk's frames and timing, the scroll), the recordings' format, what of
  `h3-view` the window needs (`clock`, `sound`: a common crate is a `lanes.toml` change agreed
  with the client lane, its inbox note of 2026-10-23), the tasks (each about half a context); the
  queued M1 items (the inbox's writer bound, R2-8).
- **Acceptance:** the epic's M2 section refined (decisions, tasks), the tasks in this queue, the
  user's agreement.
- **Depends on:** M1 closed (T6b, done). **Status:** ready (with the user).

## Inbox

Other lanes add entries here. The map client lane turns each into a task, or keeps one line here
while the work waits.

- 2026-10-24 (this lane, E24 M1 T6b's reviewer, R2-8; with the next writer pull request): the
  writer's edge bound for an object (`crates/h3-map/src/writer/extras.rs` `PAST_RIGHT`, `PAST_BOTTOM`, its test
  at 799) lets an anchor lie 7 past the map's side, where an 8-wide template covers no cell on
  the map: one too generous, its comment off by one (6 and 4, or the comment). The adventure
  lane's crate: a `cross-lane` change, so it waits for the next addition the situations need.

- 2026-10-23 (the adventure lane, E08 T47a; for information, nothing to do): the harness's
  clicks and reads for batch E6 (`clients/capture/README.md`, "Screens and their items"): the
  screen showing is the topmost dialog's kind by its vtable (`h3mem.dialog`), and a click finds
  its item by id among the dialog's items in memory, which now carry their boxes, states and texts
  (`h3mem.dialog_items`; `dialog_text` shares `item_text`); the hero screen, exchange, army,
  creature and split dialogs' items by name (`h3adv.SCREEN_ITEMS`); a step's `screen = "hero"`
  and `actions`; a battle's tactics phase ended at once in `fight` (its message's OK, then Start).
  The harness check gained Kit and Full (Blue's eight heroes): passed under Wine.

- 2026-10-23 (the client lane, E17 M3 T9c, at the split): moved here from the client lane's
  inbox, the adventure lane's entry of 2026-10-21 (E08 T30, decision 65, ADR-0017 point 6 amended
  in #353; for the hot-seat client, E24 M5): **a level-up holds the game.**
  While a hero's level-up with two offers is open, the engine accepts no command but its owner's
  answer (`h3_game::GameState::waiting_for` names the owner; `level_up(owner)`, or the owner's
  `GameObservation.decision` as `DecisionView::LevelUp`, gives the hero, level, primary skill and
  the two offers; `Answer::First`/`Second` answer it). A battle's defender that won answers it
  outside its turn. The user's requirement for hot seat: when the player who must act changes,
  show a handover screen that hides everything (map, hero list, the dialog) until that player
  confirms it is in control, then the level-up dialog alone, and hand back to the player whose
  turn runs the same way, so no one sees another player's view.
