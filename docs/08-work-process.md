# 08 — Work process for agents

## Planning levels (just-in-time refinement)

1. **Vision / architecture / ADRs** — stable, changed deliberately (ADR).
2. **Backlog** (`BACKLOG.md`) — coarse epics in rough priority order. Cheap to reorder. One or two lines each until they are close.
3. **Refined epic** (`epics/Exx-*.md`) — only for the next one or two epics: goal, scope, non-goals, exit criteria, task list. Refine an epic when it becomes next, not before.
4. **Task** — sized to fit one focused agent session (a coherent change that can be verified). If it does not fit, split it or deliver partially (below).
5. **HANDOFF.md** — the living state between sessions.

Do not over-specify. A refined epic is allowed to be wrong after first contact; update it.

## Session protocol

**Start:** follow the checklist in `AGENTS.md`.

**Interruptions:** a session can be stopped at any time and resumed later, possibly by a fresh agent. Follow "Interruptions and resuming" in `AGENTS.md`: sync every commit to the user's repo immediately, keep HANDOFF resumable at task boundaries, checkpoint when the user announces a stop, and rebuild from the user's repo when resuming.

**During:**
- Keep the main line green. Commit small, coherent steps with messages in the ubiquitous language.
- Write the test and the rule entry with the code, not afterwards.
- If you discover work: add a coarse backlog item or a stub registry entry; do not silently expand scope.
- If you hit a decision that might be big: stop and ask (see below).

**End:** follow the checklist in `AGENTS.md`. A partial delivery is acceptable if:
- the repo builds and `verify` is green,
- unfinished parts are explicit (stub registry, epic task checklist, HANDOFF "next steps"),
- nothing half-implemented is reachable in a way that could corrupt state (prefer returning a typed `NotImplemented` error behind the validator over partial behavior).

## Stub registry

Incomplete or deferred code is tracked in `docs/stubs.toml`:

```toml
[[stub]]
id     = "STUB-0001"
where  = "crates/h3-battle/src/spells.rs::cast"
reason = "Spells not part of E01"
epic   = "E03"
```

Code refers to the stub id in a comment (`// stub: STUB-0001`). `xtask check-stubs` fails if logic code contains `todo!`, `unimplemented!`, `#[ignore]` or TODO markers without a registry entry, or if a registry entry has no matching code marker.

## When to interrupt and ask

See `AGENTS.md` for the list. Protocol:

1. Write the question in `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`: context, options, consequences of each, your recommendation, what is blocked.
2. If the user is present, ask interactively (short, concrete, with options). If not, finish the safe work, record the state in HANDOFF, and stop.
3. When answered: record the decision (ADR for architecture-level; note in the relevant doc otherwise), remove/mark the question answered.

## ADRs

Use `docs/adr/0000-template.md`. One decision per ADR. Statuses: Proposed, Accepted, Superseded by ADR-NNNN. Do not edit an accepted ADR's decision silently; supersede it.

**Size:** ADRs hold decisions only (about 80 lines); working detail goes into the epic's design note (`docs/epics/<epic>-design.md`), which each task prunes as it implements it. Full rule: `docs/adr/README.md`, "Keep ADRs short".

## Branching and commits (provisional — OPEN-QUESTIONS Q3)

Trunk-based: short-lived branches, small commits, main always green. Conventional-style prefixes are welcome (`feat(battle): …`, `fix(game): …`, `docs: …`). Attribution trailers follow the session's configured instructions.

## Definition of Done

See `05-testing.md`.

## Backlog hygiene

- New discoveries → coarse items at the bottom or in the right place by priority.
- Completed epics are marked done with a one-paragraph summary and links to ADRs.
- Keep the backlog short and honest; delete items that stopped being relevant.
