# Backlog

Coarse epics in rough priority order. Only epics marked **Refined** have an epic file. Everything else is a sketch that will be refined when it becomes next. Reordering is cheap; update this file when priorities change.

Status: `todo` · `next` · `in-progress` · `partial` · `done`

| ID | Epic | Status | Detail level |
|---|---|---|---|
| E00 | Foundations: vision, architecture, ADRs, process docs | done (2026-09-30) | — |
| E01 | **Walking skeleton**: minimal battle end to end (workspace, gates, kernel, tiny content pack, battle core, commands + validation, observation, sim env, CLI, replay + hash, benchmark) | next | **Refined** → [epics/E01-walking-skeleton.md](epics/E01-walking-skeleton.md) |
| E02 | Content pipeline: catalogue the user's game archives/data tables, import into content packs, pack manifest/format, `Ruleset` compiler, synthetic test packs | todo | outline |
| E03 | Battle core (RoE rules): hex geometry, movement, melee/ranged, retaliation, abilities via Tier-3 primitives, morale/luck, damage, obstacles, war machines; bonus/modifier system in kernel | todo | outline |
| E04 | Heroes & army, artifacts, skills, specialties, spell book; battle spells (magic) | todo | sketch |
| E05 | Simulation env v1 + baselines: batch API, forkable envs, masks, random + heuristic bots, FFI, Python smoke binding | todo | sketch |
| E06 | Battle AI v1 + local training pipeline v0 (evaluation gate, opponent ladder, experiment records) | todo | sketch |
| E07 | Formats: map (.h3m) reader, scenario loading, validation/fuzzing | todo | sketch |
| E08 | Adventure map core: tiles, movement, pathing, day/week/month, resources, a first subset of objects, fog of war | todo | sketch |
| E09 | Town & economy: buildings, construction, recruitment, growth | todo | sketch |
| E10 | Game orchestration: players/teams, turns, battle integration via contracts, victory/defeat, projections/visibility (security), scenario setup | todo | sketch |
| E11 | AB and SoD completeness (content + rules), expanded from E02–E04 as needed | todo | sketch |
| E12 | Map objects long tail | todo | sketch |
| E13 | Adventure AI (hierarchical) + training on generated maps | todo | sketch |
| E14 | Map generator (seeded from user's existing project; objective-driven: zone balance, few teleports, …) | todo | sketch |
| E15 | Acceptance tests (BDD) suite — grows alongside features | todo | parallel/ongoing |
| E16 | Server, protocol, auth hooks, rate limiting, fuzzing/hardening | todo | sketch |
| E17 | Clients & asset pipeline (web/WASM, desktop) — outside the core | todo | sketch |
| E18 | Extension API spike (WoG/HotA-shaped requirements), modding tooling | todo | sketch |
| E19 | Original save-file import (low priority) | todo | future |
| E20 | Campaigns | todo | future |

## Ordering rationale

1. **E01 first** validates determinism, the command/event model, security shape, performance, gates and the sim API on the smallest possible slice.
2. **E02–E03 before AI**: the battle must be faithful before it is worth training on.
3. **E05–E06 early**: the AI is the motivator; a working battle training loop de-risks the performance and API decisions sooner than a large adventure map would.
4. Adventure/town/game (E07–E10) follow; security projections (E10) build on the skeleton's observation API.
5. Map generator, long-tail objects, clients and server come when their dependencies exist.
